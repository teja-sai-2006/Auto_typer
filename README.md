# Auto_typer
Futures of the application
1)This application is used to simulate typing on the keyboard based on the script the user saved in it
2)The typing starts when the hotkey set by the user is pressed, and it types automatically based on the script you saved for that hotkey.
3)It works only when the application runs in the background. If you close it, it turns out to  work
4)It also had random backspace, it randomly backspaces and retypes it again, in it look more humanized.
5)The random backspace is set on the probability of backspace that the user entered, which should be (0 to 1)..If 0.1 is entered, the probability is 10%
6)And the user should also set the minimum and maximum number of backspaces, so when this probability occurs, the program will randomly select that number between the backspace and retry it again.
